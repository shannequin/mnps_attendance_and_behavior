Using data collected from Metro Nashville Public Schools and the State of TN research, we want to analyze the attendance and behavior of the students.
* Hypthesis: The rate of behavior incidences is significantly higher for male students than female students.
* Null Hypothesis: The rate of behavior incidences is not significantly higher for male students than female students.
